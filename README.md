# 3-Test
Tests 3 different kinds of conditions
It allows a user to pick prepicked expressions to test.
The 3 tests are:
1)Palindrome Test: tests if an expresssion is a palindrome
2)Balance Test: tests if an expression is balanced (if there is a closing bracket for every open bracket and vice versa)
3)Evaluation Test: Evaluates expressions in postfix notation

A user can also choose to input their own expression, pick which test they want to do, as well as have to option to 
rerun the test for as long as they want.
